         data tracking system is another challenge in API testing. This
         integration is essential in bringing back the appropriate responses
         on whether a call is working properly. It is also useful in
         monitoring the API performance. Tracking system integration is a
         late stage in a whole process, which cause the team not to give it
         enough attention.</p><p class="- topic/p ">It can be improved by planning since the design phase to see how
         it will integrate with other systems. Each application has various
         requirements that need to be met. So, the team should not test in
         parallel with other critical integration systems. This can be
         achieved by implementing and adding load testing in the continuous
         delivery.</p><p class="- topic/p ">See also:</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">
