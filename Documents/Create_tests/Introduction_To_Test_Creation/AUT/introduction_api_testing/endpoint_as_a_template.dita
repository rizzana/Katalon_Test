      <title class="- topic/title ">Endpoint as a template</title>
      <conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody ">
        <p class="- topic/p ">   This endpoint is a part of the <xref href="/katalon-studio/tutorials/data-driven-testing/" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">data-driven
            approach</xref>, which relates to data models more than input data.
         One of the most challenging issues in API testing is test data
         mapping with data models, subsets of data models. For examples:</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">   An API creating new Jira issue requires an
         input data model having required fields (such as Project Key,
         Summary) and non-required fields (such as Description, Assignee,
         etc.). All the combination of required and non-required fields
         should be tested to ensure that all the test scenarios are covered.
         For each combination, we then apply data-driven to test with
         different data set.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">   This practice suggests that we consider each
         combination as a test template for the endpoint, then apply
         data-driven approach for this test template to generate actual
         executable test scenarios.</p>
