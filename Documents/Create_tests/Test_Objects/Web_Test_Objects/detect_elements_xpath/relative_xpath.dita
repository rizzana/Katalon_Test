        <p class="- topic/p ">You might want to use the relative XPath method to observe a
         pattern in the attribute values like ID or Class of the web
         element. Relative XPath (smart XPath) is the path that starts from
         the middle of the HTML DOM structure. Unlike the absolute XPath
         that starts from the root, relative XPath starts with the double
         forward-slash (//), which means it can search for the element
         anywhere on the webpage. Therefore, you can start from the middle
         of the HTML DOM structure without writing a long XPath. For
         example: <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">//a[contains(text(), 'Katalon Studio')]</codeph>.</p>

        <p class="- topic/p ">You can find a list of XPath capture strategies in Katalon
         Studio using relative XPath in this document: <xref href="../web-selection-methods/configure_xpath.dita" class="- topic/xref ">Configure
            XPath</xref>.</p>
