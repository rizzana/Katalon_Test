      <p class="- topic/p ">An alert is a Javascript function which is used to notify users
         on a Web page. It displays a dialog with a specified message and
         OK/Cancel buttons.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The alert is a modal dialog that takes the focus away from the
         current window and forces the user to take action before performing
         other actions. It also prevents the user from accessing other parts
         of the page until the user performs the action presented in the
         dialog. For example, when the user clicks on the "Delete" button,
         an alert would be triggered asking user 'Are you sure, you want to
         delete?' The user has to take action on this dialog.</p>

      <p class="- topic/p ">Such an alert can be handled using Katalon Studio built-in
         keywords. This tutorial shows how to do so with HTML examples. You
         can get the HTML by clicking <xref format="html" href="https://github.com/katalon-studio/katalon-web-automation/blob/master/Html%20Files/How%20to%20Handle%20Alerts2.html" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">here</xref>.</p>
