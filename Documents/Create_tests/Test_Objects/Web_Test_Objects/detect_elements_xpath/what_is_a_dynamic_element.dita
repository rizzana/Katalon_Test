        <p class="- topic/p ">One of the challenging and time-consuming tasks in test
         automation is to modify test scripts when the AUT is changed,
         especially in the early stages of software development. Developers
         may change identifiers and elements quite often from one build to
         another. In addition, during the execution, the AUT elements may
         change dynamically.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Dynamic web elements are elements whose IDs and any other
         attributes like class names or values keep changing when you
         refresh the page. Dynamic elements are database-driven or
         session-driven. For example, when you edit an element in a
         database, it changes a number of areas of the application under
         test.</p>
