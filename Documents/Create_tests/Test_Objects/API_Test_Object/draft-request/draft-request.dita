         with new features and capabilities. Occasionally, you may want to
         send a request with different test data before adding the data to
         your test case. Katalon Studio allows you to create a Draft Request
         to experiment with various data. All sent requests are saved in the
         ‘Request History’ panel on the left sidebar which you
         can retrieve anytime.</p><p class="- topic/p ">To create a draft request, click on the ‘New Draft
         Request’ icons (REST or SOAP) on the main toolbar or from
         Quick Start Wizard in the ‘Help’ menu.</p><p class="- topic/p ">Katalon Studio will open a ‘Draft Request Details’
         view based on the selected request type. Here, you need to enter
         all the required request information. You can also leverage the
         ‘Verification’ feature to verify the response values if
         they match with the predefined API specification.</p><p class="- topic/p ">

    </p><p class="- topic/p ">If you decide to add a draft request to your test case, select
         the desired request and click ‘Save.’ You will be asked
         to specify the name and target folder in ‘Object
         Repository.</p><p class="- topic/p ">
