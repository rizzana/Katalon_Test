         iframe. And this control needs to be handled in a specific manner
         when testing. An iframe (Inline Frame) is an HTML document embedded
         in another HTML document. The iframe HTML element is often used to
         insert the content from another source, such as an advertisement,
         into a Web page.</p><p class="- topic/p ">Verifying text and objects within iframes can be a challenge.
         For example, even though you can see a text displayed in an iframe,
         automation tools may not be able to detect the text. You have to
         tell your script how to traverse through a website's iframes
         structure and select the correct iframe where the text and its
         object are present. This article shows you how to handle iframes
         properly in Katalon Studio.</p></conbody></concept>
