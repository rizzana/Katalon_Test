         the absolute XPath, which can be copied from the browser, is
         sufficient. There is no need to find a better approach for this
         type of project.</p><p class="- topic/p ">However, if the AUT is large and its life cycle is long,
         including the maintenance phase, you have to think about the
         locator strategy seriously. A wrong approach may lead to wasting
         tremendous time and effort to update and maintain test cases.</p></conbody></concept>
