      <p class="- topic/p ">With coordinates-based recording, Katalon Studio records an
         element's relative coordinates in addition to its selector. For
         instance, you want to click on the red X part to close a tab in
         Notepad. Katalon Recorder records the button's offsets (its
         relative coordinates to its top-left corner) as a set of parameters
         representing an X and Y offset, and save them in
         clickElementOffset. It uses them to identify the exact location to
         perform a click action during runtime.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Without that element's offsets, the test engine can only click
         on the button's center, resulting in a failed test.</p>
