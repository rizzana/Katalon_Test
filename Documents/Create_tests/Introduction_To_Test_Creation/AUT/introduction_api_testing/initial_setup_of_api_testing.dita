         manual testing confirms whether the app works, automated testing
         helps to check how effectively the app performs under pressure.
         Setting up the test infrastructure get it working is considered
         among the most challenging tasks of the testing process, as it is
         not only particularly tricky but also a significantly
         motivation-killer. However, it will be a long-term benefit once the
         team gets through those challenging setup process.</p><p class="- topic/p ">To avoid these challenges, teams need to start the API testing
         in the early stage, specifically in the design phase and make sure
         to conduct the interval checking of APIs for 100% uptime.</p></conbody></concept>
