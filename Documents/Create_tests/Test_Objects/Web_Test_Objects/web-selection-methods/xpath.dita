If an element cannot be consistently located using its direct attributes, Katalon Studio identifies the element by using its more robust neighbors. This method is visually intuitive as it reflects the way users often identify a visible element on the user interface.</p><p class="- topic/p "><image width="600" href="image/ks-selection-method.png" class="- topic/image "/></p><p class="- topic/p ">Working with XPath, you can:</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">Set the priority of XPath locators.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Decide which object properties are used to recognize objects.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Override the global settings in a specific object.
