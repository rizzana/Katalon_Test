      </note><p class="- topic/p ">In Katalon TestOps, you can execute tests in parallel. During
         parallel execution, Test Runs are automatically load-balanced. This
         means that each time a Test Run starts, the Test Run is distributed
         to an available and active local test environment, minimizing
         execution time.</p><p class="- topic/p ">When a Test Run is executed, the test sessions will be assigned
         to the previously configured Agents in this order of priority:</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">Idle Agents</li><li class="- topic/li ">Agents that have not exceeded their Threshold</li><li class="- topic/li ">Agents with the least number of queued Test Runs</li></ul><p class="- topic/p ">When an Agent completes a Test Run session, queued jobs that
         were first assigned to other Agents can be automatically reassigned
         to this Agent for immediate execution.</p></conbody></concept>
