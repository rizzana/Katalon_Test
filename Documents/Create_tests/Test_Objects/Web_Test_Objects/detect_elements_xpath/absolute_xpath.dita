        <p class="- topic/p ">XML documents are treated as trees of nodes, in which the
         topmost element of the tree is the root element.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Absolute XPath is the path starting from the root. An absolute
         XPath starts with HTML and forward-slash (/).</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">For example:
         <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[3]/div[2]/div</codeph>
        </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">In Katalon Studio, the XPath capture strategy for absolute XPath
         is <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">xpath:position</codeph>. Using absolute XPath is a simple
         way to solve the problem when dealing with dynamic elements.
         However, if something changes in the structure of your web page,
         this XPath might fail. Therefore, absolute XPath is not recommended
         for detecting dynamic elements.</p>
