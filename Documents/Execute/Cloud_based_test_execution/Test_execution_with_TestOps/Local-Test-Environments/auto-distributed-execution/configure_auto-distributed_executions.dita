          <p class="- topic/p ">To enable Auto-Distributed Executions, make sure that you have
               at least 2 active Agents. You can learn how to set-up Agents here:

                  a Local Test Environment</xref>.</p>
        </li><li class="- topic/li ">

          <p class="- topic/p ">Make sure that your Test Suite Collection is configured for
               parallel execution. If not, you can follow these steps: <xref href="../kt_run_parallel_agent/kt_run_parallel_agent.dita" class="- topic/xref ">Run
                  multiple Test Suites in Parallel</xref>.</p>
        </li><li class="- topic/li ">

          <p class="- topic/p ">Create a Test Schedule and assign your Test Run Types to those
               Agents. Learn more: <xref href="../../../../Schedule_test_executions/Schedule-test-runs-in-testops/schedule_test_runs.dita" class="- topic/xref ">Schedule

            share a minimum of 1 mutual Agent for distributed execution. In
            other words, assign Test Run Types to multiple, overlapping
            Agents.</p></li></ul>
