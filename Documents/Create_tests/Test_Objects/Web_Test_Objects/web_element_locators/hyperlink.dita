            the 'click' action. A hyperlink is displayed as a text with or
            without an underline, in a different color. Hence, the a
            hyperlink's locator is very similar to that of a text or
            labelâ€”except that the 'a' tag is used. If a hyperlink does
            not include text or its URL is more stable than its text, you
            should use the 'href' attribute.</p><p class="- topic/p ">
