      <p class="- topic/p ">The figure below shows three different layers of testing called
         <xref format="html" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">the
            test pyramid</xref> initially coined by Mike Cohn in his book
         Succeeding with Agile. It has layers representing different types
         of testing. Despite its being overly simplistic, it offers us a
         general rule of thumb: it suggests how much testing we should focus
         on at each layer. As such, API and services tests in the second
         layer is an important testing activity that we should focus on.</p>

      <p class="- topic/p ">Unit/component tests: This lowest level of testing brings the
         highest value and ROI. It is mainly performed by developers. The
         unit/component tests can attain between 70% and 80% of code
         coverage and require as much effort.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Business rules/Functional tests: This level of testing focuses
         on business rules of the application under test. The tests are
         designed to test against user stories to ensure that all
         implemented functions are working as expected. In Web and mobile
         applications, data shown in the user interface is often returned
         from servers via API/services. So API testing is performed to
         ensure the accuracy of API/services. Testing at this level may need
         about 20% of the total testing effort.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Workflow Tests (through the UI): functional UI testing is
         performed via the UI of the application to ensure that its features
         are built as expected. Due to the fact that automated functional UI
         testing is brittle, and any changes in the UI can break the tests,
         test automation teams should focus less on this level of
         testing.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">API testing yields the highest ROI compared to all other testing
         type performed by testers as Unit test performed by developers
         mostly. It also offers a number of advantages over other kinds of
         testing:</p>
