        <p class="- topic/p ">When starting to develop test scenarios, some of us are
         relatively common to jump right into some of the negative test
         scenarios (to verify invalid information, validation on special
         characters, uncommon input, etc.). These types of verification
         might cause crashes and other interesting problems. In other words,
         easy bugs might be found quickly with negative test scenarios.
         Unfortunately, it is not necessarily the best use of a tester's
         effort. It is suggested that mainline scenarios should be focus
         first with higher priority. A basic guideline is to identify the
         most common parameters and conditions that an end developer will
         use when calling the APIs and test these scenarios extensively.</p>
