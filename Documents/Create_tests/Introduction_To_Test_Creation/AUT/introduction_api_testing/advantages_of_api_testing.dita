    <conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody ">
      <p class="- topic/p ">As discussed above, API testing is an important activity that
         testing teams should focus on. It offers a number of advantages
         over other kinds of testing:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        <li class="- topic/li ">
          <p class="- topic/p ">Language independent: Data is exchanged via XML and JSON, so any
               language can be used for automation, independent from the languages
               used to develop the application. XML and JSON are typically
               structured data so the verification is fast and stable. There are
               also built-in libraries to support comparing data using these data
               formats.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">
          <p class="- topic/p ">GUI independent: We can perform API testing within the
               application prior to GUI testing. Early testing will get feedback
               sooner and improve the team's productivity. Core functionality can
               be tested to expose small errors and to evaluate a build's
               strengths.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">
          <p class="- topic/p ">Improved test coverage: Most API/services have specifications,
               allowing us to create automated tests with high coverage, including
               functional testing (happy cases, negative cases) and non-functional
               testing. With virtual user techniques, we rarely find API test
               cases that could not be automated.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">
          <p class="- topic/p ">Faster releases: It is common that executing a UI regression
               test suite takes 8-10 hrs while the same scenario with API testing
               takes only 1-2 hours. The flakiness of API testing is also lower
               than that of UI testing. All these allow us to release faster with
               API testing.</p>
