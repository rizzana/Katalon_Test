        <p class="- topic/p ">   The most important feature of any API test
         tools is the capability of the data-driven approach. Lacking
         data-driven ability will lead to test data hardcoded, duplicated
         test scripts, test verification, therefore causing massive effort
         at maintenance phase.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">   Together with data-driven, there are some
         important notes for test data that we should pay attention
         seriously: data types, blank, empty, null string. With RESTful web
         services, the input data is typically in JSON format, and missing
         value of a specific key is considered differently (null, empty) in
         some cases. To avoid these ambiguous test scenarios, using a subset
         of input data models are highly suggested.</p>
