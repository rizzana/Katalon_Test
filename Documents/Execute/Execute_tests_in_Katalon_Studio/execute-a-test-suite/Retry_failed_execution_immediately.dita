            </note><p class="- topic/p ">By default, each test case is run only one time in a test suite execution. Suppose you want to rerun failed test cases several times to identify flaky tests before executing the next ones. You can set the desired number of retry times in <uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Retry Failed Execution Immediately</uicontrol>. The failed test case will be rerun immediately until they pass or all retries are used up. If all rerun attempts fail, Katalon Studio marks that test case as <uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Failed</uicontrol> and proceeds with the rest in the test suite.</p><p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Consolidate Reports</b></p><p class="- topic/p ">From version 8.1.0 onwards, Katalon Studio automatically consolidates reports in JUnit, HTML, PDF, and CSV format with one final test result for a test case. Browser-based or window-based videos are recorded for runs and reruns of a test case.</p><p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Usage example</b></p><p class="- topic/p ">In this example, we have a test suite with five test cases. We set <uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Retry Failed Execution Immediately</uicontrol> for one and two times. When we run the test suite and a test fails, Katalon Studio immediately reruns the problematic test case until it passes or the maximum number of retries is reached.</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">

                    <p class="- topic/p ">You can see the test suite status once the test suite finishes executing. Because test case 3 is marked as <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Failed</b>, we open the <uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Result</uicontrol> tab and expand test case 3 to investigate.</p>
                    <p class="- topic/p ">test case 3 failed twice, once during the main run and once as a retried run. Only one retried run was allowed.</p>
                    <p class="- topic/p ">At this point, <ph conkeyref="name-variables/katalon-studio" class="- topic/ph "/> logged its final result as <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Failed</b> and continued to execute test case 4 and 5 with the same logic.</p>
                    <p class="- topic/p ">You can view how many test cases in the test suite were executed and their final status in the <uicontrol class="+ topic/ph ui-d/uicontrol ">Summary</uicontrol> tab. In this use case, the test suite has five total test cases; test cases 1, 2, and 4 pass while 3 and 5 fail.</p>

                    <p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Example 2</b>: Execute the test suite with a Retry limit of 2:</p>
                    <p class="- topic/p ">When we set the retry limit to 2, five test cases passed. Test cases 3 and 5 failed at the main run and first rerun but passed at the second try.</p>
                    <p class="- topic/p ">Since test cases 3 and 5 did not succeed on the first try but still succeed after two tries, their result pattern is intermittent. This is a clear sign of test flakiness and can be further investigated.</p>
