      <p class="- topic/p ">API testing is a type of software testing that involves testing
         application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of
         integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for
         functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Since APIs
         lack a <xref format="html" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">GUI</xref>,
         API testing is performed at the message layer and can validate
         application logic very quickly and effectively.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">API testing is critical for automation testing and CI/CD process
         because it can cope with short release cycles and frequent changes
         especially the presentation layer without breaking the test
         outputs. API testing also requires less maintenance effort compare
         to UI automation testing which makes it a preferred choice for
         Agile and DevOps teams.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">A side note, for Web and mobile applications, API often means
         Web services, and API testing refers to the automation test
         performed to the Web services.</p>
