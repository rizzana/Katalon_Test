      There are some cases in which you can identify an object's locator
      only when it's runtime. In other words, the exact locator of the
      intended object cannot be specified beforehand in test scripts. In
      the<xref href="https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/profile.php#login" scope="external" class="- topic/xref "> Cura Healthcare Center appointment web
      page</xref>,
      for instance, there are three options of the healthcare program,
      and the selected one is only known with passing data during
      execution. </p><image height="567" href="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/manage-web-test-object/medicare.png" scope="external" width="670" class="- topic/image "/><p class="- topic/p "> How can we specify an option in a test
      script? By parameterizing its locator. You need to create only one
      Test Object, and you can determine which the exact object is with
      the passed data during execution. </p><p class="- topic/p ">Now for the exciting part: How do
      you determine which attribute(s) you have to adjust to parameterize
      this object's XPath? The answer to this question is mainly based on
      your knowledge of the web AUT. Knowing the pattern of how similar
      objects are grouped is the key. In this case, the index's value of
      <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">label attribute</b> is the value to parameterize for options on
      the current web screen. </p><p class="- topic/p ">Depending on your preferred <xref href="../manage-web-test-object/manage-web-test-object.dita" class="- topic/xref ">selection
      method</xref>,
      including XPath (Smart XPath), Attributes or CSS, the captured
      object has a corresponding selected locator. </p><p class="- topic/p ">Below steps are how to
      apply parameterizing test objects in this case:
<ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li "><p class="- topic/p ">Capture the <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">XPath</b> locator of those 3 options and save them to the Object Repository in Katalon Studio.</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Medicare</b>: <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">//*[@id=\"appointment\"]/div/div/form/div[3]/div/label[1]</codeph></li><li class="- topic/li "><p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Medicaid</b>: <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">//*[@id=\"appointment\"]/div/div/form/div[3]/div/label[2]</codeph></p></li><li class="- topic/li "><p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">None</b>: <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">//*[@id=\"appointment\"]/div/div/form/div[3]/div/label[3]</codeph></p></li></ul></li></ul>As can be seen in the captured XPath
         locators of those 3 options,
         they share this same pattern <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">//*[@id=\"appointment\"]/div/div/form/div[3]/div/label</codeph>; hence, in this case, the property variation is the label index.</p><p class="- topic/p "><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li "><p class="- topic/p ">In the test object view of the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Medicare </i>object, create
         an XPath property and enter the captured XPath locator as its
         value. </p></li></ul><image href="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/param-web-object/label1.png" scope="external" class="- topic/image "/>
      <ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li "><p class="- topic/p ">Create a variable as a place holder for the property change in
         the locator with this syntax:<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">${Variable_name}</codeph></p><p class="- topic/p "> In
         this case, it's the label index so we create
         <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">[${index}]</codeph>. </p><p class="- topic/p ">Modify this XPath value with that variable. There are two
         options for you: to parameterize the whole XPath value or merely a

         There are other approaches you can apply in your test scripts to
         reduce the efforts of maintaining many Test Objects at the same
