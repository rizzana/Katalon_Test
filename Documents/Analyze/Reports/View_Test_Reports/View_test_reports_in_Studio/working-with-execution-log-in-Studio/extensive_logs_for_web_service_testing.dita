Since version 5.9.0, Katalon Studio has included the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">HAR</codeph> file in the log of Web Service execution. The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">HAR</codeph> file contains low-level data to help you identify critical performance problems with Web services quickly.</p><p class="- topic/p ">Upon sending requests, a relative <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">.har</codeph> file is recorded and made accessible from execution logs. The file is stored directly on the current executed machine.</p><p class="- topic/p "><image width="700" href="image/ks-har-file.png" class="- topic/image "/></p><p class="- topic/p ">These <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">.har</codeph> files are stored in the requests' main folder under the generated report folders if you execute Web Service Suites.</p><p class="- topic/p "><image width="500" href="image/ks-request-har.png" class="- topic/image "/></p><p class="- topic/p ">Using the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">.har</codeph> file in services analyzer such as <xref href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">HAR Analyzer</xref> of Google Admin Toolbox can provide quality insights about the Web Service request and response. This helps the project team quickly identify key issues and efficiently allocate resources to address the issue. Some issues that can be identified include:</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">Performance issues: slow page load, a timeout when performing a specific task</li><li class="- topic/li ">Page rendering issues: incorrect page format or missing information</li></ul></conbody></concept>
