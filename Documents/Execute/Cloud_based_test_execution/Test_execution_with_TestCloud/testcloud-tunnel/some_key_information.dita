      <p class="- topic/p ">After starting the run command, the tunnel client does two
         things:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        <li class="- topic/li ">Spin up a fresh virtual machine (VM) that is used only for
            testing.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">Connect you to the TestCloud Tunnel server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="- topic/p ">By default, the tunnel is closed after 30 minutes if there is no
         request or traffic (i.e. the tunnel is idle for 30 minutes).
         Consequently, the VM is shut down.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">To start the tunnel again, enter the run command in the tunnel
         client.</p>
