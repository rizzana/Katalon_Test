            in both images.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Distinguishable (red border): shows UI zones that look
            identical for the most parts but have some recognizable
            distinctions.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Missing/New (pink border): shows UI zones that exist in one
            image but not in the other.</li></ul><p class="- topic/p ">This method is helpful to review changes identified by the
         pixel-based comparison, and it spots the changes in layout, color,
         font, and element location.</p></conbody></concept>
