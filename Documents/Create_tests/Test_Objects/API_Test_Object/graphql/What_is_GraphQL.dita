GraphQL provides a detailed and easy-to-understand description of the data in your API, making it easier to evolve APIs over time. GraphQL queries get many resources in a single request and always return predictable results. Therefore, GraphQL significantly improves the efficiency and performance of API calls.</p><p class="- topic/p ">To learn more about GraphQL, you can refer to GraphQL documentation: <xref format="html" href="https://graphql.org/learn/" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">Introduction to GraphQL</xref>.</p></conbody></concept>
