      <p class="- topic/p ">Commonly, applications have three separate layers or tiers
         including Presentation Layer or user interface, Business Layer or
         application user interface for business logic processing, and
         Database Layer for modeling and manipulating data.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">API Testing is performed at the most critical layer, the
         Business Layer, where business logic processing is carried out, and
         all transactions between User Interface and Database happen.</p>
