      <p class="- topic/p ">This article presents some strategies for locating Web
            elements on a webpage in different situations. These strategies
            reflect the user's mindset when perform UI Automation tests: First,
            think about simple static locators. Then when simple methods are no
            longer working, gradually increase the complexity of the
            solution.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">It is important to mention that the following principle
            must be held in deciding locators: the locator must be unique,
            readable and maintainable. If the locator does not uniquely
            represent the target element, technical problems will arise during
            the maintenance phase as there is no way to know which locator
            should be changed.</p>
