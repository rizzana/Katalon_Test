      <p class="- topic/p ">When a smartphone is a must-have for everyone, it is required
         for a web application to accommodate both desktop browsers and
         mobile browsers.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Often, a desktop UI and a mobile web UI will vary for the same
         web application since the screen of a desktop is different from
         that of a phone (in resolution, size, ratio, for example). Thus, a
         web application with responsive implementation can adapt to various
         devices, which might cause a problem during the quality assurance
         period. The same element in different implementation for desktop
         and mobile may have different locators, and this fact alone can
         prevent our test cases from executing correctly on mobile
         browsers.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Do not stress out when your test cases cannot execute properly
         on mobile browsers as they do on desktop browsers. Automation
         testing is all about understanding the AUT (Application Under Test)
         clearly to find a suitable approach. This practice should be a top
         priority before we want to continue testing our web
         application.</p>
