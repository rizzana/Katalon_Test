         API and other integral parts. It is mainly about the UI functions,
         in which the interface is naturally graphical or rely on the
         command-line endpoint calls.</p><p class="- topic/p ">Generally, the test is more likely of the interface which ties
         into the API rather than the API testing itself. Although UI
         testing is not a specific test of API in term of the codebase, this
         still provides overview information about the health, usability,
         and efficiency of both front-end and back-end.</p></conbody></concept>
