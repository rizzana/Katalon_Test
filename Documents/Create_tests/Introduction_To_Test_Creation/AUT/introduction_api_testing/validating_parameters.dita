         parameters sent through API requests because of the sheer number of
         parameters and use cases for those parameters. Testers need to
         ensure all parameter data uses the correct string or numerical data
         type, fits within length restrictions, fits within the designated
         value range and pass other validation criteria.</p><p class="- topic/p ">To solve this problem, testing team can use the continuous
         synthetic API monitoring to detect the problem early. Besides, it
         should be combined with an APM solution to get the 360-degree
         view.</p></conbody></concept>
