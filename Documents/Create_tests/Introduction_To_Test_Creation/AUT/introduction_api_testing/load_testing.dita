         whole codebase has been completed to check if the theoretical
         solutions work as the practical plan. Load testing is performed to
         ensure the performance under both normal and at peak conditions. To
         do so, load testing takes on some various scenarios:</p><ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">Baseline – tests the API against theoretical regular
            traffic that the API expects in ordinary usage;</li><li class="- topic/li ">Theoretical maximum traffic – this is to make sure during
            the full load periods, the solutions respond to those requests
            properly;</li><li class="- topic/li ">Overload test – to test the maximum capability according
            to the theory, then add 10-20% more on the peak traffic.
             </li></ul></conbody></concept>
