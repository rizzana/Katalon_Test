      <p class="- topic/p ">Since reliable image-based testing depends on image comparison,
         you can reduce the chance of failures in two ways:</p>

            <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Screen Resolution</b>: The screen resolutions of
               screenshot capturing devices and test executing devices can affect
               the accuracy of image comparison. We recommend capturing
               screenshots and executing tests on the same device for the best
               results.</p>

            <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Capture tool</b>: We recommend using built-in
               capture tools in Web Recorder and Spy utility since they
               automatically resize the captured images.</p>
