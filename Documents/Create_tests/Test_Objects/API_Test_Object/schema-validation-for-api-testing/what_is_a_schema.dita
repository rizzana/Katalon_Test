The document being validated or described is called the instance, and the document containing the description is called the schema. A schema validation asserts constraints on the structure of the instance data. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in using schemas, such as a JSON or XML schema, as a basis for contract testing. You can learn more about the reason why we need to maintain the schema during the testing process in this document: <xref href="../../../Introduction_To_Test_Creation/AUT/introduction_api_testing/update_the_schema_of_api_testing.dita" class="- topic/xref ">Update the Schema of API testing</xref>.</p><p class="- topic/p ">The infographic below demonstrates the role of JSON/XML schema in API testing:</p><p class="- topic/p "><image href="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/schema-validation/Validate-Format.png" scope="external" width="500" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Infographic</alt></image></p><p class="- topic/p "><i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Infographic based on the Automation Step By Step course: What is JSON Schema</i></p><p class="- topic/p ">Learn more from the JSON Schema documentation: <xref format="html" href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about.html#about" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">What is a schema?</xref> </p></conbody></concept>
