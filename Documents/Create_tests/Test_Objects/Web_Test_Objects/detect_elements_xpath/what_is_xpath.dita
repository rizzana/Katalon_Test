      <p class="- topic/p ">XPath stands for XML Path Language. In an XML document, XPath
         uses path expressions to navigate through elements, attributes, and
         select nodes or node-sets.</p>

      <p class="- topic/p ">On a webpage using the HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
         structure, you can also use XPath to find the location of any
         element. To learn more about HTML DOM, you can refer to the
         W3schools documentation: <xref format="html" href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp" scope="external" class="- topic/xref ">What is
