<concept id="id_23" class="- topic/topic concept/concept "><title class="- topic/title ">Testing parameter combinations</title><conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody "><p class="- topic/p ">APIs handle communication between systems by assigning data
         values to parameters and passing these parameters through data
         requests. Testing all possible parameter request combinations in
         the API is necessary to detect the problems regarding the specific
         configurations. A more significant project would end up assigning
         two different values to the same parameter, or create instances
         where numerical values appear when text values should be. Adding
         parameter will aggressively increase the number of possible
         combinations.</p><p class="- topic/p ">This challenge can be solved by picking some applications that
         aren't very critical to daily operations to utilize the API and
         release it to those applications only. By doing this, testers can
         know how the API is utilized and whether there are any changes
         should be done for a general availability release.</p></conbody></concept>
