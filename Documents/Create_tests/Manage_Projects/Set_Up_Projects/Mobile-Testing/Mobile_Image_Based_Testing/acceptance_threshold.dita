      <p class="- topic/p ">There is an acceptance threshold to define the possible outcome
         of image comparison. Acceptance threshold in Katalon Studio is set
         0.4 by default, which means any found image with the similarity
         measure less than 0.4 will be rejected. This threshold is based on
         the default match threshold in Appium.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">On the scale from 0 to 1, you can customize the acceptance
         threshold, which defines the degrees of match by using the
         <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">IMAGE_MATCH_THRESHOLD</codeph> option. It's recommended to use
         the default threshold <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">0.4</b> to find your match. If
         you're not finding matching objects, you can try a lower acceptance
         level; if the returned objects are wrongly matched, raise the
         threshold value. For example, to set 0.6 as the match
         threshold:</p>
