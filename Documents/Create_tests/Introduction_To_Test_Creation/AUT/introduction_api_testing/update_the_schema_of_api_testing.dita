         for the API) should be maintained during the testing process. Any
         changes in the program that create additional parameters for the
         API calls must be reflected in the schema configuration.</p><p class="- topic/p ">In today's API economy, the changes in API helps facilitate the
         demand, but those changes can cause downtime. To avoid this issue,
         the team needs to test the API in beta and alpha environments,
         which is seen to reduce 90% of the chances of issues happen.</p></conbody></concept>
