         troubleshooting automation test execution. The critical information
         in the log can quickly help project teams pinpoint the root causes
         of any issues. Katalon Studio execution logs are optimized to
         provide such information so that you can have a comprehensive view
         of the tests run.</p></conbody></concept>
